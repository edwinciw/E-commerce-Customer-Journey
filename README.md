# Customer Journey Analysis Using Markov Chain Attribution
Understanding how customers navigate an e-commerce website is crucial for identifying the most effective traffic sources and support marketing decision making. This repository applies Markov Chain Attribution to analyze website traffic, evaluating the impact of various acquisition channels such as direct visits, paid search, and display ads.

The above displayed is a Markov Chain diagram that maps out the visitors traffic source sequences â€” similar to an amusement park map that shows all the attractions and the paths between them. But instead of just showing the routes, this map also displays the proportion of visitors moving from one point to another, giving insight into how users navigate toward a final destination (conversion). In evaluating the proportions, this helps to uncover how different traffic sources contribute to conversions, providing actionable insights into customer behavior.

**How to use**:

- 'Data Extraction.ipynb': Extracts public data [link](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/bigquery-public-data:google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801) on Google Cloud using SQL queries.
- 'Multi-touch Attritbution.ipynb': Analysis on customers' (visitors') journey on the e-commerce's website.
- 'Source Performance over Time.ipynb':  Evaluates traffic source performance and forecasts revenue trends.
- 'agg_data.zip': Contains all extracted datasets from Data Extraction.ipynb.

This analysis helps businesses allocate marketing resources more effectively by understanding the influence of different acquisition channels on conversion rates.

## Main Results
### Multitorch-Attribution Model
The following is a heatmap of the transition matrix of the percentage of visits from sources to sources of the starting source, which also includes:

- 'start' the starting point when the visitor first assess the website since August 2016.
- 'null' as the end point of most recent visits before August 2017.
- 'conversion' is when the visitor converted and made a purchase on the website.

For example, from 'start' to 'Affiliate', there is a 1.8\% of all visits starting at 'start' that ends at 'Affiliate'.

</p>
The main observations are:

- The three main entry source of the website is 'Direct' (38\%), 'Referral' (26\%), and 'Search' (33\%), which most visitors were introduced to the website from those sources. The other sources have less than 2\%. 
- Most purchases and conversiosn occurred through 'Direct' (1.2\%), 'Display Ad' (1.1\%), and 'Paid Search' (0.93\%).
- The sources with the highest 'null' percentage are 'Referral', 'Search', and 'Affiliate', implying these sources are more unlikely to keep visitors and customers to return to the website.
- For the source to source interactions, the path to the same sources has second highest percentage right under 'null'. 'Paid Search' and 'Display Ad' has a higher percentage (2.2\% and 4.4\%) of visits going to 'Direct'; 'Paid Search' has the highest percentage (1\%) going to 'Display Ad', and 'Display Ad' has a similar percentage (0.86\%) going to 'Paid Search'.

## Recommendations
- Most visits and revenue were generated from organic search and direct assess, suggesting that most purchases were likely made by returning visitors since the visitors must have known the website. Therefore reallocate budget on the sources that are more likely to keep visitors revisiting, being paid search and displayed advertisements, improving and investing more on the quality and quantity of these sources. Furthermore, paid search and displayed advertisements have higher conversion rate compared to the other sources. 
- On the other hand, drop affiliation if they make losses since affilate has the lowest conversion rate and high exit percentage compared to other sources. Even though referral also has a high exit percentage, it is one of the main source that introduce visitors to the websites that can be controlled by the company, so it is better to keep and maintain partnerships in referrals.

## Questions
- What's the commission rate for different partnerships? This determines whether affiliate is making losses throughout the year, and relocate budget to different partners that can make referrals to the target consumers based on return of ad spent (ROAS). Can the commission be renegotiated?
- Why does referral have a high exit percentage? Which referral site drives the most high-intent traffic? And can we exclude spam referrals?
